"""
Demo script to train a network based on:

  - a range of noise levels
  - a given frame rate
  - a selection of ground truth data sets

The model configuration is defined based on a couple of parameters (sampling rate,
training data sets, noise levels, ground truth smoothing). A folder is generated
on the hard disk with the name 'model_name'.

Finally, the model is trained, "cascade.train_model( model_name )" and the trained
models are saved to disk.
